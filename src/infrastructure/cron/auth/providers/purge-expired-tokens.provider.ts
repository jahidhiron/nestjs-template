 * Hard-deletes stale refresh tokens from the database.
 *
 * A token is considered stale when either condition is true:
 *
 * - `revoked_at IS NOT NULL` — explicitly invalidated (logout, token rotation,
 *   or suspicious-activity detection). The row is retained only long enough for
 *   theft-detection comparisons; once here, it is permanently unusable.
 *
 * - `expires_at <= NOW()` — TTL has elapsed. Even a non-revoked token cannot be
 *   presented after its expiry, so the row has no operational value.
 *
 * Called once per day by {@link PurgeExpiredTokensCronService} to prevent
 * unbounded table growth for dormant accounts (active accounts are cleaned up
 * per-user during sign-in by {@link CleanupRefreshTokenProvider}).
